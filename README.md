# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree in python

Copy paste the code in python. I have written this code in pycharm.
When you download the dataset make sure you enter the entire path to the csv file.
In output you would be getting a dot file, run that fun on online graphic visualization engine and the image would be displayed of decision tree.
